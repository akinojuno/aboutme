<h2>From food design, to web design...</h2>
<article><p> 
	What motivates me the most is the possibility of becoming a part of something bigger than myself. Other than my dream of working for big tech companies
	and creating a food related app, I also want to be able to create something that would help children with special needs. In the long run, I am hoping to
	get a job that would not require me to be in the office most of the time so I can spend more time at home with my little cousin, who has a developmental delay.
